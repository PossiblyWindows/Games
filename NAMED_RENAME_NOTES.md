1. **Configuration Files**:
   - Ensure that any build scripts referencing 'client' are reviewed for correctness.

2. **Documentation**:
   - The README should be checked to ensure all mentions of 'client' are correctly updated.

3. **Code Imports**:
   - Check all imports to ensure they point to the new folder name.

Please review the above points after the renaming process.
